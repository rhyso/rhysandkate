                                Due to this (bloody) pandemic, it was looking increasingly unlikely that our orignal date would be going ahead;
                                so we have made the call, alongside the venue and registrar, to move everything to next year.

                                 We will now be getting married on:<br/> 
                                <h2 className="new-date-update">Saturday 5th June 2021 @ 1pm</h2>
                                

                                A year seems like a long time away right now! But we will all be very well rested and ready to <b>party even harder</b> by next June!

                                <br/><br/>

                                We will send out more details later in the year, but the general plan remains the same, just next year!

                                If you need any help on moving accommodation etc let us know and we can advise the best we can!
